# NGScloud2
NGScloud2, a major version of NGScloud, provides a user-friendly front-end to operate the EC2 resources and to control bioinformatic analysis workflows of NGS experiments in a modular way. The application allows to optimize the cost-efficiency ratio of NGS experiments when appropriate computational facilities are not available.
